                        The system " My virtual school " can be
                        used by both teachers and students.
                        It would be in great use for all
                        levels of education in Bulgaria.
                        After you sign in,you would be
                        able to see the interesting
                        modules,which include a forum,
                        an electronic system for homework
                        and many useful resources.

                        Teachers would be able to post
                        homework for students.
                        They would also be able
                        to post articles in the forum,
                        which would help the students
                        manage their homework correctly.
                        They would be able to answer the students'
                        questions at any time. After receiving the
                        homework and checking it,they would be
                        able to mark it and send notes.

                There are many opportunities for the
                students as well. They will be able
                to follow the schedule with their
                homework, do it on their computers
                and then quickly send it
                electronically to their teacher.
                The students’ contribution to the
                blog will be crucial. One of the
                pages will give them the opportunity
                to contact other students and discuss
                questions, occured in the process of
                executing the task and to share their
                experience and resources. They can also
                ask the teachers questions and get an answer.
                After handing in their homework, the students
                will receive a mark and remarks on the task.
